"""
Institution Plugin System

This module provides the base architecture for institution-type-specific features.
Each institution type (faith, sports, political, youth, women) can implement
custom features while sharing the core institution infrastructure.

FAANG Principle: Plugin architecture enables 80% code reuse while maintaining
clear separation of concerns for type-specific features.
